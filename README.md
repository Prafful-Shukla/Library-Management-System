# Library-Management-System
This repository contains the codebase for a scalable and robust Library Management System, developed as a backend web application using Java, Spring Boot, and SQL. The project demonstrates a proficiency in various web technologies and backend development concepts.
## Key Features:
### Spring Boot and IoC: 
The system leverages Spring Boot to create a well-structured application with easy configuration. Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) have been implemented to achieve loose coupling between components, improving maintainability and facilitating unit testing.

### Lombok for Code Readability: 
Lombok is utilized to reduce boilerplate code, leading to cleaner and more concise code. This enhances code readability and makes the development process more efficient.

### RESTful APIs with Spring-Web: 
The system employs Spring-Starter-Web to build RESTful APIs, enabling seamless communication and efficient handling of requests and responses between the client and server.

### Maven for Dependency Management: 
The project utilizes Maven for managing project dependencies, simplifying the build process, and ensuring a smooth deployment of the application.

### SQL Database Integration: 
A SQL database is integrated into the system to store and manage library-related data efficiently. This ensures data persistence and provides a reliable foundation for the application.

### MVC Design Pattern: 
The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, organizing the codebase into distinct models, data access objects (DAOs), controllers, requests, and services. This design pattern enhances code maintainability and scalability.

## Skills Demonstrated:

Proficiency in Java, Spring Boot, SQL, and backend system design.
Expertise in system development, API integration, and database management.
Instructions:
To run the Library Management System locally, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your system.
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Library-Management-System.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd Library-Management-System
Build the project using Maven:
mvn clean install
Run the application:
Once the application is running, you can access the RESTful APIs through the defined endpoints and perform library management operations.
## Note:
This project is intended to serve as a demonstration of backend development skills and may not include a complete user interface. The APIs can be integrated with a frontend application to provide a full-fledged library management system experience.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and provide feedback to improve the project further. Happy coding!
